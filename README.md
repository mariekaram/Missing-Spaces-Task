*'Missing_Spaces_df.ipynb':

I read the text file using pandas (read it as dataframe) but i miss some of data. 

*'Missing_Spaces_txt.ipynb':

I read the text file as it is, i got all data.

*In poth of them i tried to restore the missing spaces to the text using 'WordSegment' (makes it easy to use a different corpus for word segmentation), but wordsegment.segment lowercases all input and removes punctuation. 

*Jupyter notebook (create word segment.ipynb):

- I tried to create word segment but i didn't finish it.
