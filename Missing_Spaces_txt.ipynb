      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    Word segmentation is the process of dividing a phrase without spaces back\n",
      "    into its constituent parts. For example, consider a phrase like \"thisisatest\".\n",
      "    For humans, it's relatively easy to parse. This module makes it easy for\n",
      "    machines too. Use `segment` to parse a phrase into its parts:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> from wordsegment import load, segment\n",
      "    >>> load()\n",
      "    >>> segment('thisisatest')\n",
      "    ['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']\n",
      "    \n",
      "    In the code, 1024908267229 is the total number of words in the corpus. A\n",
